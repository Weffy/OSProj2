For this file, there are 16 page
s and 32 bytes of data in each p
age.  Again, I have made such a 
datafile by putting 32 character
s on each line, and encoding sac
h one using UTF-8, which encodes
the Latin alphabet and punctuati
using 8 bits, or 1 byte, per let
ter. Letters from other alphabet
s usually need more than 1 byte 
to encode them, but I have not u
see any in this example datafile
. There are also other methods f
or encoding characters as bits, 
such as UTF-16, which uses 16 bi
ts per letter. abcdefghijklmnopq
